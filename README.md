# VHDL Labs

This repository contains my VHDL lab codes completed during the course.  
Each lab demonstrates key digital design concepts using VHDL, including simulation and implementation.

## Structure

- **Labs 1-4**:  
  VHDL source files (`.txt`) along with testbenches where needed.

- **Labs 5 and onward**:  
  Full project folders created using **Xilinx ISE**.  
  You can directly open these projects in ISE, build, simulate, and see that they work correctly without needing to set up the project manually.
